> Updated on 2025-08-20 by @KemingHe

## Event Context

- **Event**: Google Public Sector & Ohio State University 2025 Data & AI Day  
- **Date**: Thursday, 2025-08-21, 01:30pm-06:30pm ET  
- **Location**: Ohio Stadium, Columbus, OH  
- **Target Audience**: Ohio State faculty and researchers (specifically Track 1: Researchers)  
- **Demo Time**: 5-10 minutes maximum (accounting for intro/outro/survey)  
- **Primary Objective**: Showcase capabilities of Gemini Pro (chat, Deep Research, Canvas) and NotebookLM (podcast, video walkthrough, multi-document chat) working seamlessly together.

## Target Audience Analysis

### Ohio State's Top Research Disciplines (FY2024)

**Overall**: $1.58B total R&D expenditures (#14 nationally, ahead of Harvard/Yale)

1. **Materials Science and Engineering** - NSF MRSEC Center for Emergent Materials, $4.2M PREM award (2024)
2. **Agriculture and Food Science** - $26M NSF TARDISS ERC (2024), $10M USDA grant, $67M annual research  
3. **Automotive Engineering and Mobility** - $26.5M DOT grant for new CAR facility, $3.8M DOE battery grant
4. **Welding Engineering** - One of the only comprehensive B.S./M.S./Ph.D. programs in the nation
5. **Clinical and Translational Health Sciences** - $477.3M research funding (College of Medicine), $245M NIH

### Strategic Topic Selection

**Chosen Topic**: "Advanced Materials for Next-Generation Batteries"

- **Intersects**: Materials Science (#1 strength) + Automotive Engineering (#3 strength)
- **Institutional Assets**: Center for Emergent Materials (NSF MRSEC, in 3rd six-year term) + Center for Automotive Research (new $26.5M facility)
- **Federal Momentum**: DOD funding up 31% YoY, NSF up 19%, positioning OSU in advanced materials/energy storage
- **Broad Appeal**: Electric vehicles and climate change resonate universally across disciplines

## Current Demo Strategy - the "Grant Proposal Accelerator"

### Core Value Proposition

Address universal faculty pain point: finding relevant grants and aligning institutional resources - typically hours of tedious work reduced to minutes.

### Tool Responsibilities

**Gemini Pro**: Dynamic content fetching and generation

- Web search and Deep Research capabilities
- Finding current funding opportunities
- Real-time information retrieval

**NotebookLM**: Static content analysis and synthesis

- Multi-document chat analysis
- Cross-referencing existing materials
- Audio overview generation (podcasts)

### Demo Workflow

#### Materials Faculty Already Have (Pre-loaded in NotebookLM)

1. **PI Curriculum Vitae** - Dr. Alexander Steve's publication history, expertise in solid-state electrolytes (mock)
2. **Lab & Facilities Summary** - CAR Battery Testing Lab capabilities, IMR characterization tools  
3. **Preliminary Data Summary** - Novel polymer electrolyte research results (mock)
4. **Broader Impacts Statement** - Standard STEM outreach and diversity commitments

#### Live Demo Steps (AI-Generated Content)

**Step 1: Find the Opportunity** (Gemini)

- Prompt: "Find a current Department of Energy funding opportunity for electric vehicle battery development"
- **Value**: Solves "needle in a haystack" problem of grant discovery

**Step 2: Upload Grant Document** (NotebookLM)

- Import DOE funding announcement PDF to existing document collection
- **Value**: Seamless integration of new external requirements with existing assets

**Step 3: Generate Alignment Analysis** (NotebookLM)  

- Prompt: "Draft a 'Statement of Need' showing how Dr. Alexander Steve's CV, CAR facilities, and preliminary data align with this funding announcement's objectives"
- **Value**: Automates the "connecting the dots" intellectual heavy lifting

### Expected Outcome

Concise, bullet-pointed justification document that directly maps institutional strengths to grant requirements - typically the most time-consuming and critical part of proposal writing.

## Key Ohio State Assets for Battery Research

**Research Infrastructure**: CAR Battery Testing Lab, Center for Emergent Materials (NSF MRSEC), Institute for Materials Research (IMR) with advanced characterization facilities

**Industry & Federal Connections**: $774.2M federal funding (FY2024), $159.5M industry-sponsored research, partnerships with Ford/GM/Honda/LG Energy Solution

**Cross-disciplinary Expertise**: Materials scientists (battery materials), mechanical engineers (thermal management), chemical engineers (electrolytes)

## Past Pivots & Current Strategy

### Evolution of Demo Focus

#### Initial Approach: Research Discovery Workflow

**Original Plan**: Use Gemini Deep Research to surface trending papers → Import into NotebookLM → Extract conclusions/future work → Identify research opportunities

**Why Pivoted**: Too complex for 5-minute demo; required audience to follow multi-step analysis

#### Pivot 1: Single Discipline (AI Research)

**Concept**: AI tools researching AI - meta-relevant demonstration

**Pros**: Clean self-referential loop, high interest across disciplines

**Cons**: "Navel-gazing" perception, risk of expertise mismatch with CS faculty

#### Pivot 2: Niche OSU Specialty (e.g., Welding Engineering)

**Concept**: Target Ohio State's #1 globally ranked program

**Pros**: Shows deep homework, impressive to field experts

**Cons**: Alienates 90% of audience - welding engineers engaged, others checking phones

#### Pivot 3: Interdisciplinary Grand Challenge

**Breakthrough**: Don't pick a discipline, pick a *problem*

**Topic Selected**: "Advanced Materials for Next-Generation Batteries"

- Combines Materials Science (NSF MRSEC) + Automotive (CAR)
- Universal appeal: electric vehicles and climate change
- Allows pulling from chemistry, engineering, and policy

#### Final Pivot: Grant Proposal Accelerator

**Realization**: Focus on universal faculty pain point instead of research discovery

**Why Superior**:

- Every faculty writes grants (100% audience relevance)
- Demonstrates immediate time-saving value
- Shows clear tool separation: Gemini finds opportunities, NotebookLM aligns resources

## Success Metrics

- Faculty survey responses indicating interest in using Gemini/NotebookLM for research
- Demonstration of seamless workflow between Google AI tools
- Clear articulation of time-saving value proposition for academic research processes
