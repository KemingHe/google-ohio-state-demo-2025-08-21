Archive for Google x Ohio State 2025 Data & AI Day "Grant Proposal Accelerator" demo showcasing seamless integration of Gemini Pro and NotebookLM for faculty research workflows.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains comprehensive demo materials demonstrating how AI tools can reduce faculty grant writing workload from hours to minutes. The presentation showcases the "Grant Proposal Accelerator" workflow using real Ohio State CAR Energy Storage Labs context with completely PII-free mock documents to ensure safe public demonstration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1 - Review the Demo Strategy

Start with [`README-demo-strategy.md`](./README-demo-strategy.md) for complete event context, audience analysis, and the Grant Proposal Accelerator workflow.

### Step 2 - Understand Mock Document Methodology  

Read [`README-mock-strategy.md`](./README-mock-strategy.md) for the 4-principle isolation strategy ensuring zero PII exposure while maintaining semantic alignment.

### Step 3 - Explore Demo Materials

Navigate to [`mocks/`](./mocks/) for complete fictional CV and research data, [`grants/`](./grants/) for DOE funding opportunity materials and NotebookLM outputs, and [`reference/`](./reference/) for authentic CAR Energy Storage Labs institutional context.

## 🎯 Demo Workflow

The Grant Proposal Accelerator demonstrates three key steps:

1. **Find the Opportunity** (Gemini Pro): Discover current DOE funding opportunities using optimized web search prompts
2. **Upload Grant Document** (NotebookLM): Import funding announcement PDF with existing faculty materials  
3. **Generate Alignment Analysis** (NotebookLM): Automatically draft Statement of Need connecting institutional strengths to grant requirements

This workflow addresses the universal faculty pain point of grant discovery and proposal alignment, typically reducing hours of work to minutes.

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

All mock documents follow strict PII isolation principles:

- **Complete Name Separation**: Fictional collaborators replace all real personnel
- **Project/Funding Differentiation**: Modified amounts, agencies, and focus areas  
- **Technical Focus Shift**: Complementary but distinct research (hybrid electrolytes vs silicon anodes)
- **Physical Space Separation**: Different office locations within same campus context

Real institutional context from Ohio State CAR Energy Storage Labs provides authentic alignment opportunities while maintaining zero data conflicts.
