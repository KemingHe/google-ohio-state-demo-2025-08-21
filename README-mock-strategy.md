# README - Mock Document Strategy

> Updated on 2025-08-21 by @KemingHe

## Core Objective

Create **completely isolated fictional documents** that maintain semantic alignment with real institutional context while ensuring **zero PII overlap** for safe demo use.

**Case Example**: Dr. Alexander Steven academic CV for CAR Energy Storage Labs demo

## Critical Isolation Principles

### 1. Complete Name Separation

**Never use real names** - replace all personnel references with fictional alternatives

- **Real Collaborators** → **Generic Fictional Names**
- **Example**: "M. Canova, G. Rizzoni" → "Dr. Martinez, Dr. Thompson"

### 2. Project/Funding Differentiation

**Avoid real grant/project conflicts** - modify amounts, agencies, or focus areas

- **Real Projects** → **Alternative But Realistic Projects**
- **Example**: "NASA ULI $10M" → "NSF Future Manufacturing $2.8M"

### 3. Technical Focus Shift

**Complementary but distinct research** - same domain, different specifics

- **Real Institution Focus** → **Mock Character Focus**
- **Example**: "Silicon anodes" → "Hybrid organic-inorganic electrolytes"

### 4. Physical Space Separation

**Different locations within same context** - maintain realism without conflicts

- **Same Building, Different Rooms** or **Different Buildings, Same Campus**
- **Example**: "Scott Laboratory" → "Baker Systems Engineering"

## Quality Standards

### Professional Authenticity

**Make it believable** - maintain institutional patterns and career progressions

- **Realistic Rank/Experience Level** for target use case
- **Appropriate Funding Portfolio** showing success without conflicts  
- **Logical Career Progression** with plausible timelines
- **Institutional Integration** that feels natural

### Content Depth Requirements

**Match real-world complexity** - avoid oversimplification that breaks immersion

- **Sufficient Publication Record** with realistic metrics
- **Professional Service Activities** appropriate to rank/experience
- **Industry/Collaboration Networks** that make sense
- **Student/Mentoring Portfolio** matching career stage

## Implementation Best Practices

### Document Quality Standards

**Professional formatting** - maintain format expectations for document type

- **Consistent Style Guide** (markdown, academic standards, etc.)
- **Proper Section Organization** following domain conventions  
- **Clean Formatting** without errors that break immersion
- **Appropriate Length/Detail** for intended use case

### Safety Mechanisms

**Clear fictional markers** - ensure no confusion about document authenticity

- **Obvious Mock Indicators** at document start/end
- **Placeholder Values** for sensitive identifiers (ORCID, phone, etc.)
- **Realistic But Fictional Metrics** (citations, funding amounts)
- **Time-Bounded Scope** to limit potential conflicts

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Safety Verification

- [ ] **Zero Real Names** - All personnel references are fictional
- [ ] **No Project Conflicts** - All funding/projects are modified or fictional  
- [ ] **Distinct Technical Focus** - Research areas complement but don't duplicate real work
- [ ] **Physical Separation** - Locations avoid real office/lab conflicts

### ✅ Quality Verification

- [ ] **Professional Standards** - Document meets domain expectations
- [ ] **Realistic Complexity** - Sufficient detail for believable analysis
- [ ] **Clean Formatting** - No errors that break document credibility
- [ ] **Demo Compatibility** - Supports intended workflow without issues

## 5-Step Development Process

1. **Scope Definition** - Document type, use case, institutional context
2. **Content Framework** - Realistic structure following domain conventions
3. **Isolation Review** - Cross-check against all real reference materials
4. **Quality Polish** - Professional standards and error-free formatting
5. **Safety Verification** - Complete PII separation and fictional markers

## Key Principle

**Maximum isolation with semantic alignment** - completely fictional but professionally realistic for AI tool demonstrations requiring authentic-feeling content without PII risks.
