## I. Executive Summary & Program Purpose

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), specifically the Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO), aims to improve transportation by driving innovation in advanced technologies, significantly enhancing U.S. competitiveness, and reducing pollution from the transportation sector. The program will achieve this by accelerating the deployment of advanced technologies, leading to benefits such as "increased safety and reliability of batteries, more convenient travel options, decreased cost of driving, increased vehicle and system efficiency, and a more secure supply chain." (I.A, I.B).

The transportation sector is a significant focus, accounting for approximately 30% of total U.S. energy needs and being the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the energy sector. A core objective is "Providing better and cleaner transportation options that are affordable for all Americans." (III.A).
